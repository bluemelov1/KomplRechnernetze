# Complex internship: computer networks
By Hannes BlÃ¼mel, Philipp Herold, Aleksey Ermoshin
## Motivation 
This internship aims to investigate the potential benefits for replacing VyOS, an open-source network operating system, with a NixOS system based on one configuration file to build it. Background for this is that building VyOS is like fighting an uphill battle. The required packages and dependencies to build VyOS are numerous and need a specialist to solve. 
NixOS on the other side has it advantages in its reproducibility of packages, which means that packages are isolated from another and have no dependencies on each other.
The question to ask now is: can we use the advantages of NixOS and reproduce the functionality of VyOS with it? 

To resolve this we are going to analyze the networking functionality of VyOS. Then we derive 3 real world scenarios which include sub-functions of VyOS. These scenarios will then be build by using NixOS. To complete our proof-of-concept we will write a translator which converts a VyOS configuration, with the functionality of the 3 scenarios, to the NixOS configuration, so that afterwards both systems have the same scope of functions.

## Background 
### VyOS

VyOS, a versatile network operating system and offers a wide range of use cases we will list some of them here. 

- VyOS supports various routing protocols such as OSPF, BGP, RIP
- It supports VPN technologies including IPsec, OpenVPN, L2TP, and PPTP, enabling secure remote access and site-to-site connectivity
- VyOS offers firewall functionality, allowing administrators to control traffic flow and enforce security policies
- It supports Network Address Translation (NAT)
- VyOS can function as a DHCP server, providing automatic IP addresses to client devices on the network.
- The system supports Virtual LAN (VLAN) functionality, enabling network segmentation
- The operating system offers high availability features such as VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol), ensuring network resilience and redundancy
- VyOS can be deployed on various hardware platforms, including physical servers, virtual machines, and cloud environments, providing flexibility and scalability
- It supports Multi-WAN load balancing and failover, distributing network traffic across multiple Internet connections for improved performance and reliability
- VyOS offers a command-line interface (CLI) and a web-based management interface, providing multiple options for configuration and administration

The full list of configuration options for VyOS can be found in the documentation:
[https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/configuration/index.html#configuration-guide](https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/configuration/index.html#configuration-guide)

While VyOS offers several advantages, it comes at a price that goes beyond monetary considerations. Although it is an open-source solution, utilizing VyOS effectively can be quite expensive in terms of knowledge and expertise. Building VyOS from source code is a cumbersome process due to its reliance on various packages, not to mention the complexities involved in customizing the system to suit specific needs. This requires a significant investment of time and effort to gain a comprehensive understanding of VyOS.

### NixOS

NixOS is a Linux distribution known for its unique package management and system configuration approach. 
It is based on the Nix package manager, offering a declarative way to manage software and system settings. 
One of its key advantages is the ability to manage packages independently, meaning each package and its dependencies are isolated and self-contained. 
This approach avoids conflicts and ensures that upgrading or removing a package does not impact other parts of the system. A unique feature of this approach is to simultaneously install and switch between different versions of one package.
Upgrades in NixOS are designed to be performed as a whole, ensuring the entire upgrade process is reliable and can be easily reversed if needed.
With NixOS, the entire operating system is defined by a single configuration file, allowing for reproducible setups. 
To conclude NixOS is famous due to its reproducibility, reliability, flexibility, and the independent nature of its packages.


## Task
To demonstrate the advantages of NixOS and show its ability to provide similar functionality as VyOS, we will replicate three specific [use cases](#use-cases) in both VyOS and NixOS configurations. Additionally, we will develop a generic transformer that takes a VyOS configuration as input and generates a corresponding NixOS configuration.

The transformer will automate the process of migrating from VyOS to NixOS for the specified use cases, ensuring a smooth transition and replication of functionality.

While the initial transformer implementation will focus on the specified use cases, it can be extended by additional mapping files and configurations to cover more services. 
This flexibility allows for customization and adaptation of the transformer to suit specific needs beyond the initial use cases.
For further information see [Transformer](#vyos-to-nixos-transformer).

By successfully replicating the use cases and providing a tool to transform VyOS configurations into NixOS configurations, we aim to highlight NixOS's ability to offer comparable functionality to VyOS while using its unique features such as package isolation and reproducibility, using one config.


## Requirements

This section lists all requirements to complete this internship.

- R1: Analyze the functionality of VyOS and NixOS
- R2: Derive three use cases of VyOS and build the scenarios using NixOS 
- R3: Develop a generic transformer to convert VyOS configurations to NixOS configurations
- R4: Assess the advantages and disadvantages of replacing VyOS with NixOS 


## Use cases 
For our proof of concept we choose some realistic use cases, where we provide the VyOS functionality by NixOS. While defining our goal we divided our use cases by increasing complexity. 

The first one rebuilds a DHCP server with three clients that automatically receive an ip-addresses. Additionally to the DHCP we configured a bonding interface between two NixOS systems. 

In the second scenario we configure a wireguard VPN which simulates a remote worker to be connected to an onsite network.

The third scenario addresses the routing functionality of a VyOS device. Therefore we configure three AS border-routers exchanging network topology with their peers. 

Further description and explanation about the scenarios can be found in the according folders in this repository. [DHCP scenario](szenario1/dhcp/README.md) [Bonding scenario](szenario1/bonding/README.md) [VPN scenario](szenario2/README.md) [BGP scenario](szenario3/README.md)



## Approach 

### NixOS installation
To set up the scenarios, we choose VirtualBox as our virtualization tool. VirtualBox is a free and open-source software that enables the creation and operation of multiple virtual machines on a single physical computer. This choice helps minimize research costs since no specialized equipment is required.

To begin, we downloaded the minimal ISO of NixOS from the official website: 
[https://nixos.org/download.html#nixos-iso](https://nixos.org/download.html#nixos-iso)

We selected the minimal ISO because it offers lighter system requirements, which is beneficial when running multiple virtual machines simultaneously. There is also no the need for graphical software in our scenarios. Because of that, the command-line interface suits our purposes.

Next, we installed the ISO onto a newly created virtual machine, following the instructions provided on the NixOS website: https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-installation-manual-partitioning.

Once the virtual machine was operational, we proceeded to create virtual duplicates of it. These duplicates served as the starting point for our scenarios.


## VyOS to NixOS transformer

### What it does?

To complete our proof of concept we designed a translator which takes a VyOS configuration as an input and gives you a NixOS configuration as an output. This is possible for our use cases: 
1. DHCP server
2. Bonding
3. Wireguard configuration
4. BGP router 

### How to use it? 

1. To obtain the VyOS configuration of a running system you can utilize one of the following commands: 
```
show configuration > config.json
show configuration json pretty >config.json # only from version 1.3 available
```
(Before proceeding, ensure that Python 3 is installed on your NixOS system. )

2. Next, transfer the 'config.json' file along with the '/transformer/*' directory from this repository to your active NixOS system. Ensure that the 'config.json' file is located next to the 'transformer.py' file. 

3. Proceed by running the 'transformer.py' script. After completion, it will generate a 'configuration.nix' file. 

4. Copy the 'configuration.nix' file to '/etc/nixos/configuration.nix' and apply it to the system by executing: 
```
nixos-rebuild switch
```


### How does it work? 
The algorithm converts VyOS configuration files in JSON format to Nix configuration files in Nix format. 
It accomplishes this by taking into account the VyOS configuration and mappings, which are created for each transformation scenario.
The VyOS configuration is extracted from an active system, allowing the algorithm to work directly with real-world data. On the other hand, the mappings are manually designed and stored in the "/transformer/mappings/" directory. These mappings follow a specific syntax, explained in the [Mapping syntax](#mapping-syntax) section.
The mapping files can be expanded to cover additional services or functionalities, providing flexibility for future extensions.

The transformer itself is divided into three parts. 

The preprocessor is responsible for collecting the data and processing the representation of it. Notably, it analyses the network interface names of the NixOS system to ensure that they are configured with the appropriate name in the nix configuration. 

The main processor is responsible for applying the specified rules of the mapping files to the extracted information from VyOS and translate it to nixos config. 
This involves an iterative algorithm that scans for matches from the mapping file within the VyOS data.
The algorithm supports two types of placeholders. The first type, $X (where X is any positive integer starting from 0), stores the value of the VyOS configuration at that place in a list indexed correspondingly, which later supplement the Nix path. The second type involves the use of regular expressions. Here, the algorithm compares the value from the VyOS configuration at that place with the regex. If a match is found, the algorithm continues comparing the paths from VyOS with the mapping path until it verifies a full match. The use of regular expressions also allows for group matches with round brackets. These groups are added separately to the list of stored values and can be utilized within the NixOS configuration path of the mapping. For each match, the configuration is immediately translated and stored in the NixOS configuration.

The post processor, is designed to handle special configuration files for the use cases DHCP and BGP. When the post processor detects a configuration syntax for any of the services, it initiates a special treatment. These configurations, despite included in the configuration.nix file, follow a different syntax and require special considerations during creation. 
The mapping for these transformers is integrated into the code and relies on templates equipped with placeholders. These templates are stored in the following dictionaries in this repository: '/bgpTemplates' and '/dhcpTemplates'. When information is detected, it is immediately injected into the template. To guarantee a functioning syntax for the services, all lines lacking values are removed at the end of the process. Similar to the main transformer, these templates require a functional VyOS configuration.

The reason why we splitted these cases from the main processor are the different mapping language requirements for these configurations. For instance, unlike pure Nix config syntax, DHCP and BGP syntax can contain repeated sections requiring unique mapping treatment and programming logic like loops in a mapping language. Furthermore the needed values for DHCP need to change the representation style of the subnet mask from '/24' to '255.255.255.0' or calculate a broadcast address from the given network address and the subnet mask. 

After all the processing stages, the main file combines all the configurations into a single string and exports it to the 'configuration.nix'.


### Mapping syntax
This JSON structure defines a mapping file that helps to translate or convert VyOS configurations into NixOS configurations. The mapping syntax is designed to be as simple as possible while still providing the necessary functionality. To accomplish this we decided to use a JSON format.

```
{
    "interfaces": {
        "bonding": {
            "$0": {
                "member": {
                    "interface": {
                        "vyosValue": "$1",
                        "nixosPath": "networking.bonds.$0.interfaces=$1"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
For each interface type like 'bonding', it specifies how values are mapped from VyOS to NixOS. The "$X", where X is any positive number starting from 0, are placeholders for actual values that will be replaced during the conversion process. The "vyosValue" key represents the value from the VyOS configuration, while the "nixosPath" key represents the path to the corresponding value in the NixOS configuration.


```
{
    "interfaces": {
        "ethernet": {
            "$0": {
                "address": {
                "vyosValue": "^dhcp$",
                "nixosPath": "networking.interfaces.$0.useDHCP=true"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
One special feature is the usage of regular expressions. In the example above, the VyOS value is checked against the regex "^dhcp$". If the value matches the regex, the corresponding NixOS path is applied. This feature allows to implement if statements in the mapping process.

```
{
    "interfaces": {
        "wireguard": {
            "$0": {
                "peer": {
                    "client": {
                        "address": {
                        "additionalVyOSPath": ["interfaces#wireguard#$2#port=$3"],
                        "vyosValue": "$1",
                        "nixosPath": "networking.wireguard.interfaces.$0.peers.endpoint=$1:$3"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
The last feature is the usage of additional paths. In the example above, the VyOS configuration needs to have two matches to apply the NixOS path. First, the regular path according to the hierarchical structure of the VyOS configuration. Secondly all the paths that are given in the "additionalVyOSPath" value. This is a list of strings, where each stage is divided by a '#' and the "vyosValue" is separated by a '='. Within that string you can continue using the '$X' placeholders as well as regular expressions.
This feature allows to extract values from different positions in the VyOS configuration and save them into one NixOS path.

### Mapping Syntax limitations
Creating the mapping syntax presented some notable challenges due to the many requirements of the mapping process. Our primary task was to identify a value within the VyOS configuration, extract it, and place it into a corresponding NixOS path. However, the complexity grew when the requirement to split a single value into multiple paths within the NixOS configuration came up.

For instance, consider the address configuration in VyOS, which is expressed as "192.168.10.1/24". In NixOS, this information needs to be divided into two separate values: "192.168.10.1" as the address, and "24" as the prefixLength. We addressed this by using regular expressions with groups in our translator.

Another complexity was introduced when a single NixOS path required information from two different VyOS paths. This was particularly evident when configuring the address and port for Wireguard. VyOS maintains the address "192.168.10.2" and port "5013" as two distinct values, while NixOS requires them to be combined as "192.168.10.2:5013". To manage this, our syntax uses two prerequisite VyOS paths separated by a ';' as mentioned above.

We also encountered discrepancies the Nix syntax and configuration syntaxes for DHCP and BGP. Unlike the hierarchical order separated by '.' in VyOS, these use indents and new line separations. Additionally, these configurations contain repeating sections, like the configuration of multiple neighbors for BGP or multiple network address spaces for different interfaces in DHCP.

Adding to the complexity was the differing address requirements for the NixOS DHCP service, which needs both the broadcast address and the interface it is listening on. VyOS DHCP configuration only requires the network address with its subnet mask. The interface for the daemon is automatically selected based on the address space configured for various NICs.

These complexities exceeded the capabilities of our existing syntax. Therefore, we adopted templates to manually extract values, calculate the required information, and place them into the templates.

# Comparison
This section will discuss the benefits of using NixOS for VyOS functionality. 

Project ideas rise from problems. One problem of using VyOS as a router software is to create your own executable. Despite VyOS is open source it is very hard to build your own version of it. The reason for this is that VyOS has a lot of dependencies and packages which are not easy to install. The VyOS documentation provides a guide to build your own version of VyOS. This guide is very long and requires a lot of knowledge about the VyOS system. Building your own version of VyOS basically has two main advantages for network administrators. First you can customize the VyOS system to your needs. Second and more important you can audit the code for security vulnerabilities and be sure that no changes have been made to the code before compiling. 

Based on this motivation we now want to conclude our internship with a comparison of VyOS and the use of NixOS for VyOS functionality. We will compare the two systems by the following criteria:

### Work effort to build nixos and vyos from source code
As described above building VyOS is cumbersome. NixOS on the other side rebuilds itself every time you apply the configuration. In NixOS it is even possible to build an ISO with your own configuration, which can then be used for later installations. This is a clear advantage for NixOS.

### Usability and scope of functions
This section will discuss the usability and the scope of functions for each distribution.

The scope of functions for VyOS in the networking domain is very broad. It supports various protocols for routing, switching and high availability concepts as well as a lot of other services like firewalling, VPN connections and DHCP.
Theoretically you can install any packages on NixOS and therefore implement the same scope of functions. 
VyOS offers you a unified syntax and specialized command line interface for all services. NixOS on the other side is designed to automatically install all the packages you need. The problem arises when configuring these services. Because all daemons follow their own syntax and are not generalizable. This makes the system more error prone due to user error.
Setting up the scenarios for this project was three times faster for VyOS than for NixOS. This is also based on the better unified documentation for VyOS, in contrast to separately search through the Nix, DHCP and BGP documentation.

Our transformer, which attaches at this point by, using VyOS unified syntax to create the NixOS configuration file, is able to translate the configuration for the services used in our three scenarios. 

The usability of VyOS for routing and networking services is better than NixOS. This is based on the fact that the syntax VyOS uses is unified and therefore more user friendly than the mixture of different configuration files incorporated into one like NixOS does. 
Applying a new configuration is easy and fast for NixOS and VyOS. Therefore you just need to use one/two commands.

To conclude this section, VyOS has a clear advantage in usability. The scope of functions is equal for both distributions, but the effort which is needed to implement and use the same functionality in NixOS as in VyOS is at least tree times higher.

### Maintenance cost and security aspects
As discussed above NixOS has it advantages in the building process and VyOS in the usability. But there are also other aspects to consider. One of them is the maintenance cost. This includes the effort to update the system and the security aspects.
Updating NixOS is automatically done every time you rebuild the system with the new configuration. VyOS on the other side requires a manual update. This is a slightly advantage for NixOS.

Both distributions are open source and are supported by a large community. Therefore the security risks of malicious code are very low. 

In this comparison NixOS has a slight advantage because of automatic updates.

# Conclusion
Our internship project entailed an analysis and comparison of NixOS and VyOS, two distinct Linux distributions, in an attempt to optimize router software deployment. Each system carries its own distinct strengths and weaknesses.

The complexity of building VyOS from source is a clear disadvantage. On the other hand, NixOS offers a more streamlined and automated building process, rebuilding itself every time a configuration is applied. Additionally, NixOS can generate an ISO with user-specific configurations. 
In terms of usability, VyOS takes the lead. Despite the simplicity of NixOS's internal configuration syntax, its complexity spikes when incorporating additional services. In contrast, VyOS maintains a unified and simple syntax across all services, enabling quicker set up and adaption.

Our approach to reduce the complexity of the NixOS syntax to configure all the network services by a generic transformer was partly successful. For all services directly included in Nix the transformer works by using generic mapping files that can easily be extended. Services like DHCP and BGP, which are based on a external package and therefore have their own syntax, are not supported by the generic transformer. Instead they are handled separately. To include all syntaxes in the generic transformer, the mapping syntax needs to become more complex to support calculations and programming logic.

However, the versatility of NixOS and VyOS might be restricted in certain contexts. NixOS is a general-purpose operating system that can handle various tasks but may require more extensive knowledge and time to configure specific functionalities. VyOS, on the other hand, being a specialized networking OS, is more straightforward in its networking functions.
In the end, NixOS and VyOS both leverage the Linux kernel, so they have similar capabilities and can run on the same machines with similar drivers.

Given the specialized nature of VyOS, we do not recommend replacing it with NixOS in large environments, despite NixOS's more manageable building process. The time potentially saved during environment setup is outweighed by the ease of configuration and modification during operation offered by VyOS. We, therefore, value usability over the trustworthiness gained by self-building the system with NixOS. For individuals prioritizing trustworthiness, the choice between using NixOS or attempting to build VyOS themselves should be determined by the project size. For network  administrators with a small infrastructure and a limited amount of services NixOS is a valid option to implement these networking functionality. However for lager companies we recommend using VyOS, especially when more people need to manage the systems once installed.

Future research in this field could take two directions. The first involves creating a NixOS configuration capable of building the VyOS ISO from source code, effectively bypassing the cumbersome manual building process of VyOS while reaping the benefits of both operating systems.

Alternatively, researchers could consider the utilization of a JSON processor like "https://jqlang.github.io/jq/" or an XSLT transformer "https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/#json" to engineer a generic transformer for all configuration files, to reduce the complexity of the NixOS configuration.
